# My Java Chomp Game🍫

This is a Java-based game. You can download and run the game using the following executable JAR file.

## Instructions:

1. Download the JAR file: [game.jar](https://github.com/Hammy-t/Coding-in-Java/raw/main/chomp_game/game.jar).
2. Make sure you have **Java** installed on your system.
   - To check if Java is installed, run:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
3. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the folder where you saved `game.jar`.
4. Run the game using the command:
   ```bash
   java -jar game.jar

## 🍫 Project Details:

### 🎮 How to Play:
1. When the game starts, you are prompted to choose the size of your play space (grid dimensions).  
2. The game is played by selecting a square from the grid. Selecting a square means that every square after it (both horizontally and vertically) has been "eaten" by the player.  
3. The twist: There is a **soap** at the top-left corner of the grid. The goal is to NOT eat the soap.  
4. If there are no more edible pieces of chocolate left when it’s your turn, you lose the game.

### ✨ Most Proud Moments:
- One of the most challenging and rewarding parts of the project was figuring out how to ensure the computer doesn't try to chomp an already eaten part of the chocolate bar.  
- Another proud moment was successfully displaying the grid and implementing the logic to "chomp" pieces of chocolate from the grid properly.  
- Finally, designing the rules for the computer to play the game —especially teaching it to avoid eating the soap— was both challenging and satisfying to implement.

Enjoy the game, and may you chomp responsibly! 🍫
